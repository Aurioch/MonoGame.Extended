# Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for [MonoGame.Extended](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended), a collection of NuGet packages that make [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/) more awesome.

We're only just getting started building this documentation. If you're not finding what you're looking for we've got a number of other places to get help.

 - We've got a live chatroom on [gitter](https://gitter.im/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended)
 - We've got our own section on the [MonoGame Community Forums](http://community.monogame.net/c/extended)
 - Development is usually discussed in [github issues](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/issues)
 - We've even got a [tag on stackoverflow](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/monogame-extended) ;)

 *Initially the plan is to port over the relevant pages from the wiki. Over time, this should become the place to be for those with the need to read.*
